IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS:
-EspBridge should display deduced host and port of incoming packets, in addition to claimed host and port
-count of peers on grid remains inaccurately high after a peer is removed for non-responsiveness

SHORT-TERM FUTURE FEATURES:
-preservation of shared code on the grid when individual grid apps die/crash/terminate
-ability to dump shared code to files as documentation of performance
-chat system should be a shared timestamped array so that new joiners are updated about earlier chats, and all available codeshares
(and chat log can be saved for documentation of performance)

LONG-TERM FUTURE FEATURES:
-WAN bridges (in progress)
-audio and video sharing
-an idea that came up in orchestra rehearsal: some sort of audience interface to the grid, so that they can see shared code and browse through it (and other materials?) while at the same time not interfere with the performance in progress (or appear as a peer).  This is pretty long term, but a good idea.
