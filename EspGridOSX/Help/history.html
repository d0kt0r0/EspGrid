        <h1>EspGrid Version History</h1>
        
		<div>v0.53.5 fixed a WIN32 byte-order bug affecting OSC floats in EspOsc</div>
		<div>v0.53.4 OSC preference changes on GNUSTEP/WIN32 take effect immediately</div>
		<div>v0.53.3 command-line preference changes on Windows are immediately persistent</div>
		<div>v0.53.2 various small fixes</div>
        <div>v0.53.1 can query person-machine-broadcast-clockMode and version via OSC</div>
        <div>v0.52.1 subscription system for OSC events replaces user preferences approach</div>
        <div>v0.51.4 small fixes to enable building on Windows (GNUSTEP/MinGW)</div>
        <div>v0.51.3 Esp.sc using experimental SuperCollider Main.monotonicClock method</div>
        <div>v0.51.2 EspMessage was not setting self as delegate for EspQueue; beginning update of /esp/message protocol to times as two 32-bit ints</div>
        <div>v0.51.0 return to (basically) single-threaded architecture; new EspChannel and EspNetwork class in preparation for more complex network topologies</div>
        <div>v0.50.5 more inter-thread fixes; reformatting of OSC echo of EspChat messages</div>
        <div>v0.50.4 more inter-thread fixes</div>
        <div>v0.50.3 fixed inter-thread problem in EspCodeShare by adding a lock; various tiny fixes/changes</div>
        <div>v0.50.2 EspKeyValueController now broadcasts only when a node is the authority for a value, OR the authority for a value hasn't been heard from (time since beacon) in more than 10 seconds</div>
        <div>v0.50.1 some pruning of log statements; beacons (internal protocol) now broadcast in a random pattern (1-5s)</div>
        <div>v0.50.0 two major changes to synchronization: (a) using monotonic, epochless machine clock instead of gettimeofday and (b) each node translates monotonic, epochless machine time of each other peer into its own frame, instead of maintaining a shared, synchronized clock.</div>
        <div>v0.49 Linux/GNUstep port; request-driven messages to flexible host/ports; all UDP sent from meaningful ports; cross-thread notification mechanism for chat/log posting; general refactoring</div>
        <div>v0.48 critical bug fix in mode 1 clock synchronization</div>
        <div>v0.47 request-driven /clock/offset/* /esp/tempo/* messages (cf. TOPLAP discussions), EspClock for SuperCollider</div>
        <div>v0.46 local and remote ports for EspBridge are configurable (in GUI and via OSC)</div>
        <div>v0.45 changes to public protocol /esp/clock and /esp/beat messages, command line help, complete OSC controls</div>
        <div>v0.44 basic WAN bridge in private protocol, initial command line edition "espgridd"</div>
        <div>v0.43 addition of continuous (slow) "/esp/clock [adjustedTime] [adjustment]" messages to public protocol</div>
        <div>v0.42 reorganization of EspClock algorithms, flux measurement, plus other bug fixes</div>
        <div>v0.41 various bug fixes - improved stability relative to 0.40</div>
        <div>v0.40 reference broadcast synchronization algorithm added, plus other optimizations</div>
        <div>v0.39 addition of system for switching synchronization algorithms, race-only algorithm added</div>
        <div>v0.37-38 experiments with different EspClock algorithms</div>
        <div>v0.36 using moving average of specific latency in EspClock/EspPeerList, lock mechanism in EspClock (constrains sync adjustments to 1ms or less), more protection against corrupt transmissions, expanded unit testing</div>
        <div>v0.35 fixed nasty bug in EspClock, reduced CPU load from EspQueue, reduced bandwidth of EspKeyValueController</div>
        <div>v0.34 reorganization of code sharing to support long (>MTU) code fragments; established unit testing for some classes</div>
        <div>v0.33 various protections against malformed messages in EspOsc</div>
        <div>v0.32 added integrated help system and app icon (the latter contributed by Kearon Roy Taylor)</div>
        <div>v0.31 broadcast of immediate and scheduled arbitrary OSC messages (with or without timestamps included in the messages) (EspMessage/EspQueue)</div>
        <div>v0.30 various small changes: clock system only warns of mismatched versions once, peers are deleted when no beacon for 2 mins, OSC control of EspBeat propagates over network properly</div>
        <div>v0.29 fixed oversight in 0.28 that broke code sharing system</div>
        <div>v0.28 refinements to code in EspBeat.m (including smooth on-the-fly tempo changes)</div>
        <div>v0.27 designated port for PD; protect against divide by 0 in tempo; fixed bug where incomplete "custom application connection" in Preferences crashes app</div>
        <div>v0.26 shift to tab view in Mac OS X GUI, implementation of log window separate from chat window</div>
        <div>v0.25 EspCodeShare: all entries requestable/copyable, system to autocopy requested deliveries</div>
        <div>v0.24 EspPeerList keeps track of how long since last communication with each peer, updates status</div>

        <div>v0.16 basic EspCodeShare mechanisms via clipboard; shared control of EspBeat cyclelength</div>
        <div>v0.15 crude shared control of EspBeat on the basis of EspKeyValueController</div>
        <div>v0.14 addition of EspKeyValueController (network sharing of variables, KVC/KVO compliant)</div>
        <div>v0.13 basic EspBeat completed without user/net control</div>
        <div>v0.12 removed Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and fixed compatibility with OS X 10.6</div>
        <div>v0.11 beacon is transmitted 19 times in first 5 seconds (every 250ms) before reducing to 5s period</div>
