    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      
    <ol>
        <li>Launch the EspGrid application.  If this is the first time the application has been launched on a particular machine, go to the application's Preferences and enter your name, a name for the machine you are using, and select the local applications (for example, Max, ChucK, PD, SuperCollider) that you would like to receive messages.</li>
        
        <li>Get your friend to launch the EspGrid application.  If you are both connected to the same network, you should see your friend in the list of peers, and they should see you.  Type a chat message in the chat entry field in the middle of the "Main" tab - your friend should see your message.  For more details, see the section on "Chat".</li>
